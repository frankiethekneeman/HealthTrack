I'm not a lawyer.  I'm just a dude who made an app.  This app doesn't send any data anywhere over any wire,
and the code to prove that is in this repository.  I even disallowed backup of this data.  It's not exactly
holding gobs and gobs of data - it's rebuildable.  Your data is your own, and you can delete it at any time
by just deleting the app.

This isn't a business, so I don't have any analytics on the app.  It's just out there in case it will help you
solve some problem in your own life.
